# Self-driving-car-with-Genetic-Algorithm
An interesting autonomous driving car simulator with famous genetic algorithm in Unity. 

Build the basic Unity3D scene with Blender3D(https://www.blender.org/), see it in /Assets/Course01...

The jeep car is trained with Genetic Algorithm scripts to run smoothly in the specific track. <br/>
Absolutely, I can train the car with Unity MLagents tools with Reinforcement Learning.

# Three important files for this project in Assets folder. 
(1) CarController.cs 

(2) GeneticManager.cs 

(3) NNet.cs
